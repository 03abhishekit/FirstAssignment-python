    "Read Mode ('r'): Opens the file for reading. If the file does not exist, it raises an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write Mode ('w'): Opens the file for writing. If the file exists, it truncates the file to zero length. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Append Mode ('a'): Opens the file for appending. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file. Data written to the file is appended to the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read and Write Mode ('r+'): Opens the file for both reading and writing. The file must exist.\n",
