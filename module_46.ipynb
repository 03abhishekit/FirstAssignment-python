    "Q1. What are the Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF)? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability Mass Function (PMF): The PMF is used for discrete random variables. \n",
    "It gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value.\n",
    "Example: Rolling a fair six-sided die.\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X=x)=  {1/6   if  x∈{1,2,3,4,5,6},    0   otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability Density Function (PDF): The PDF is used for continuous random variables. It describes the likelihood of the random variable to take on a particular value. The area under the PDF curve between two points represents the probability that the variable falls within that interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Height of adult men in a population.\n",
    "f(x)= 1/ σ sqrt(2π)  *e−1/2​(x−μ​/σ)2\n",
    "\n",
    "where μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation.\n",

    "Q2. What is Cumulative Density Function (CDF)? Explain with an example. Why CDF is used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Cumulative Density Function (CDF): The CDF gives the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a certain value. For a random variable XXX, the CDF is defined as:\n",

    "F(x) = P(X<=x)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: For a normal distribution with mean μ=0 and standard deviation σ=1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Why CDF is used?:\n",
    "It provides a complete description of the distribution of the random variable.It is used to determine probabilities for ranges of values.\n",
    "It is helpful in hypothesis testing and calculating percentiles.\n",
    "\n",

    "Q3. What are some examples of situations where the normal distribution might be used as a model? Explain how the parameters of the normal distribution relate to the shape of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:Heights of people in a specific population.Scores on standardized tests.Measurement errors in scientific experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters of the normal distribution:Mean (μ): Determines the center of the distribution.\n",
    "Standard Deviation (σ): Determines the spread or width of the distribution. A larger σ means a wider and flatter curve, while a smaller σ\\sigmaσ means a narrower and taller curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Explain the importance of Normal Distribution. Give a few real-life examples of Normal Distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance:It is widely used in statistics and natural and social sciences.Many statistical methods assume normality.The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of sample means approximates a normal distribution, regardless of the distribution of the population, if the sample size is large enough.\n",
    "Real-life examples:IQ scores.Blood pressure measurements.Annual rainfall levels in a region.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What is Bernoulli Distribution? Give an Example. What is the difference between Bernoulli Distribution and Binomial Distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernoulli Distribution: It is the distribution of a random variable which takes the value 1 with probability p and the value 0 with probability (1−p) \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Flipping a coin where heads is 1 and tails is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference between Bernoulli and Binomial Distribution:\n",
    "Bernoulli distribution represents a single trial with two outcomes.\n",
    "Binomial distribution represents the number of successes in nnn independent Bernoulli trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Consider a dataset with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. If we assume that the dataset is normally distributed, what is the probability that a randomly selected observation will be greater than 60? Use the appropriate formula and show your calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Z-score formula:Z = (X−μ)/σ\n",
    "\n",
    "For X=60, μ=50 and σ=10:\n",
    "\n",
    "Z = (60−50)/10    =\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the standard normal distribution table, P(Z > 1) = 1−P(Z ≤ 1 )= 1−0.8413 = 0.1587.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Explain Uniform Distribution with an example.\n",
    "Uniform Distribution: All outcomes are equally likely within a given interval. For a continuous uniform distribution between a and b\n",

    "f(x)={1/(b−a)  if a≤x≤b 0   otherwise. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Rolling a fair die, where each number from 1 to 6 has an equal probability of 1/6.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. What is the Z-score? State the importance of the Z-score.Z-score: The Z-score indicates how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. It is calculated as:Z=X−μσZ = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}Z=σX−μ​Importance:It standardizes different data points for comparison.It is used in statistical inference to determine probabilities and identify outliers.Q9. What is Central Limit Theorem? State the significance of the Central Limit Theorem.Central Limit Theorem (CLT): The theorem states that the distribution of the sample mean approximates a normal distribution as the sample size becomes large, regardless of the population's distribution.Significance:Allows the use of normal probability models for inference about sample means.Underpins many statistical procedures and hypothesis testing methods.Q10. State the assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem.Assumptions:The samples must be independent.The samples should be identically distributed.The sample size should be sufficiently large (typically n≥30n \\geq 30n≥30).\n",
