    "Q1. What is the Probability Density Function?\n",
    "A Probability Density Function (PDF) describes the likelihood of a random variable to take on a particular value.\n",
    "For continuous random variables, the PDF is a function that indicates the relative likelihood for this random variable to occur at a given point.\n",
    "The area under the PDF curve over a given interval represents the probability that the random variable falls within that interval.\n",
