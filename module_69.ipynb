    "\n",
    "Decision Tree Classifier:\n",
    "A decision tree classifier is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks.\n",
    "It models decisions and their possible consequences as a tree-like structure. The core idea is to split the data into subsets based on the \n",
    "value of input features, recursively.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Start with the entire dataset as the root node.\n",
    "Select the best feature to split the data using a criterion like Gini impurity or Information Gain (entropy).\n",
    "Split the dataset into subsets where each subset contains data points that have the same value for the selected feature.\n",
    "Repeat the process recursively for each subset, using the remaining features.\n",
    "Stop splitting when a stopping condition is met, such as the maximum depth of the tree, minimum number of samples per node, or when the node \n",
    "is pure (all samples have the same label).\n",
    "Prediction:\n",
    "To make a prediction for a new sample, traverse the tree from the root node to a leaf node, following the decision rules at each node. \n",
    "The label of the leaf node is the predicted class for the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "Q2. Provide a step-by-step explanation of the mathematical intuition behind decision tree classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical Intuition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Impurity Measures:\n",
    "\n",
    "Gini Impurity: Measures the frequency of a randomly chosen element being incorrectly labeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gini(𝐷) = 1 − ∑𝑖=1𝐶 𝑝𝑖2\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "𝑝𝑖 is the probability of class \n",
    "i in dataset \n",
    "\n",
    "D.Entropy (Information Gain): Measures the unpredictability of the information content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Entropy (𝐷) = −∑𝑖=1𝐶 𝑝𝑖 log2(𝑝𝑖)\n",
    "\n",
    "Splitting Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "For each feature, calculate the impurity measure for the possible splits.\n",
    "Choose the split that results in the greatest reduction in impurity (highest information gain).\n",
    "Recursive Splitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply the splitting criteria recursively on each subset of the data created by the split.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stopping Criteria:\n",
    "Stop when nodes are pure or a predefined stopping condition is met (like max depth).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Explain how a decision tree classifier can be used to solve a binary classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary Classification with Decision Trees:\n",
    "\n",
    "Start with the Root Node:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the entire dataset and calculate impurity for potential splits on each feature.\n",
    "Select the Best Feature:\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose the feature that provides the best split based on impurity reduction.\n",
    "Split the Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Divide the data into two subsets based on the chosen features value.\n",
    "Recursive Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat the process for each subset until reaching a leaf node or a stopping condition.\n",
    "Prediction:\n",
    "\n",
    "For a new data point, traverse the tree based on feature values until reaching a leaf node. The leaf node provides the predicted class (0 or 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Discuss the geometric intuition behind decision tree classification and how it can be used to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geometric Intuition:\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree partitions the feature space into axis-aligned rectangles.\n",
    "Each split corresponds to a decision boundary that is perpendicular to one of the feature axes.\n",
    "The process creates a piecewise constant approximation of the decision boundary.\n",
    "Using for Predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given data point, determine which rectangle (leaf node) it falls into by following the decision rules.\n",
    "The class label of the rectangle is the prediction.\n",

    "Q9. Provide an example of a classification problem where recall is the most important metric, and explain why.\n",
    "Example: Disease Screening:\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance of Recall: False negatives (missed cases) are more critical because they mean failing to identify individuals with the disease.\n",
