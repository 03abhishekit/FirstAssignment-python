    "Q1. What are the three measures of central tendency?\n",
    "\n",
    "The three measures of central tendency are:\n",
    "Mean: The arithmetic average of a set of values.\n",
    "Median: The middle value of a data set when it is ordered in ascending or descending order.\n",
    "Mode: The value that appears most frequently in a data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What is the difference between the mean, median, and mode? How are they used to measure the central tendency of a dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: The mean is calculated by adding up all the numbers in a dataset and dividing by the count of the numbers. It is useful for datasets without outliers and gives an overall average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The median is the middle value when the data is ordered. If there is an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. It is useful for skewed distributions as it is not affected by extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode: The mode is the number that appears most frequently. It is useful for categorical data and to understand the most common value in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Measure the three measures of central tendency for the given height data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given data: [178, 177, 176, 177, 178.2, 178, 175, 179, 180, 175, 178.9, 176.2, 177, 172.5, 178, 176.5]\n",
    "Mean:\n",
    "mean = ∑ all values/number of values = 2854.3/16 = 178.39\n",
    "\n",
    "Median:\n",
    "Ordered data: [172.5, 175, 175, 176, 176.2, 176.5, 177, 177, 177, 178, 178, 178, 178.2, 178.9, 179, 180]\n",
    "\n",
    "median = (177+178)/2 = 177.5\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode= 177 and 178(both appears three times).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Find the standard deviation for the given data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given data: [178, 177, 176, 177, 178.2, 178, 175, 179, 180, 175, 178.9, 176.2, 177, 172.5, 178, 176.5]\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the mean:\n",
    "Mean=178.39\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the each deviation fron the mean, square it, and sum them:\n",
    "\n",
    "∑(xi−mean)2 = 57.639\n",
    "\n",
    "Divide by the number of observations (n):\n",
    "Variance = 57.639 / 16 ≈ 3.60\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the square root to get the standard deviation: \n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation ≈ 3.60 ≈ 1.9\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. How are measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation used to describe the spread of a dataset? Provide an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: The difference between the maximum and minimum values. It gives a quick sense of the spread but is sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance: The average of the squared deviations from the mean. It gives a measure of how much the data points differ from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation: The square root of the variance. It provides a measure of the average distance from the mean and is in the same units as the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider the datasets A: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and B: [1, 2, 3, 4, 100].\n",
    "Range for A is 4 and for B is 99.\n",
    "Variance for A is 2.5 and for B is 1536.25.\n",
    "Standard Deviation for A is 1.58 and for B is 39.2.\n",
    "The larger spread in B is evident from the higher variance and standard deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ".Q6. What is a Venn diagram?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Venn diagram is a visual representation of the relationships between different sets. It uses circles to represent the sets and their relationships, with overlaps indicating common elements between sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. For the two given sets A = (2,3,4,5,6,7) and B = (0,2,6,8,10). Find:\n",
    "(i) A∩B (intersection):\n",
    "A∩B={2,6}\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) A∪B(union):\n",
    "A∪B={0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. What do you understand about skewness in data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewness refers to the asymmetry in the distribution of data. A dataset is skewed if it is not symmetrical and has a longer tail on one side.\n",
    "\n",
    "Right skewed (positive skew): Tail on the right side is longer; mean &gt; median.\n",
    "\n",
    "Left skewed (negative skew): Tail on the left side is longer; mean &lt; median.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. If a data is right skewed then what will be the position of median with respect to mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a right-skewed distribution, the median is less than the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. Explain the difference between covariance and correlation. How are these measures used in statistical analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance: Measures the direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It can be positive (both variables increase together) or negative (one increases while the other decreases).\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation: Standardized form of covariance that measures both the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables, ranging from -1 to 1.\n",
    "Covariance and correlation are used to understand and quantify the degree to which two variables are related. Correlation is more informative because it is dimensionless and provides a standardized measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11. What is the formula for calculating the sample mean? Provide an example calculation for a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula for sample mean :\n",
    "   mean = ∑xi / n;\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example: \n",
    "   dataset[2,4,6,8,10]\n",
    "   mean = (2+4+6+8+10)/5 = 6\n",
    "       \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12. For a normal distribution data what is the relationship between its measure of central tendency?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q13. How is covariance different from correlation? \n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance indicates the direction of the linear relationship between two variables, but its magnitude is not standardized and depends on the units of the variables. Correlation, on the other hand, standardizes the measure of the linear relationship, making it dimensionless and easier to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q14. How do outliers affect measures of central tendency and dispersion? Provide an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers can significantly affect measures of central tendency and dispersion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: Outliers can skew the mean, making it not representative of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: Less affected by outliers, as it only depends on the middle value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode: Not affected by outliers.Range: Significantly increased by outliers.Variance and Standard Deviation: Increased by outliers, as they increase the squared deviations from the mean.Example:\n",
    "Consider the dataset [1, 2, 3, 4, 100]:Mean: 1+2+3+4+1005=22\\frac{1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 100}{5} = 2251+2+3+4+100​=22Median: 3Mode: None (no repeated values)Range: 99 (100 - 1)Standard Deviation: High due to the large deviation of 100 from the mea\n",
