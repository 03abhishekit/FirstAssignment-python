    "Q1. How does bagging reduce overfitting in decision trees?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) reduces overfitting in decision trees by averaging multiple trees predictions. \n",
    "Each tree is trained on a different bootstrap sample (randomly drawn with replacement) of the original dataset. \n",
    "This introduces variance among the individual trees, and averaging their predictions reduces the overall variance and overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using different types of base learners in bagging?\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex Base Learners (e.g., decision trees):\n",
    "Can capture complex relationships in the data.\n",
    "Benefit greatly from variance reduction through bagging.\n",
    "Simple Base Learners (e.g., linear models):\n",
    "Computationally efficient.\n",
    "Less prone to overfitting, even without bagging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex Base Learners:\n",
    "Can be computationally intensive.\n",
    "May still overfit if not enough trees are used.\n",
    "Simple Base Learners:\n",
    "May not capture complex patterns in the data.\n",
    "Limited improvement from bagging compared to complex models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. How does the choice of base learner affect the bias-variance tradeoff in bagging?\n",
    "\n",
    "High-Variance Base Learners (e.g., decision trees): Bagging reduces variance significantly, leading to a more balanced bias-variance tradeoff.\n",
    "High-Bias Base Learners (e.g., linear models): Bagging does not significantly reduce bias, so the primary benefit is limited variance reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Can bagging be used for both classification and regression tasks? How does it differ in each case?\n",
    "Yes, bagging can be used for both:\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification: The final prediction is typically made by majority voting among the base classifiers.\n",
    "Regression: The final prediction is the average of the base regressors' outputs.\n",
    "Q5. What is the role of ensemble size in bagging? How many models should be included in the ensemble?\n",
    "The ensemble size in bagging (number of base learners) affects its performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "More Models: Generally leads to better performance as variance is further reduced.\n",
    "Too Many Models: Diminishing returns in improvement and increased computational cost.\n",
    "The optimal number typically depends on the specific problem and dataset but is often found through empirical testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Can you provide an example of a real-world application of bagging in machine learning?\n",
    "Real-World Application Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial Market Prediction: Bagging can be used to aggregate multiple predictive models to forecast stock prices or market trends, reducing the risk of overfitting due to market noise.\n",
    "Example Implementation in Jupyter Notebook\n",
