    "Q1: Assumptions Required to Use ANOVA \n",
    "ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) requires certain assumptions to be met to ensure the validity of the results:\n",
    "    Independence of Observations:Each group or sample must be independent of the others.\n",
    "    Violation Example: If you collect data from the same subjects in different groups, the observations are not independent.\n",
    "    Normality:The data within each group should be approximately normally distributed.\n",
    "    Violation Example: If the data is heavily skewed, the normality assumption is violated.\n",
    "    Homogeneity of Variances (Homoscedasticity):The variance among the groups should be approximately equal.V\n",
    "    iolation Example: If one group has a much larger variance than the others, the assumption of homogeneity of variances is violated.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q2: Types of ANOVAOne-Way ANOVA:Used when comparing the means of three or more independent groups based on one factor.Situation: Comparing the mean test scores of students from different teaching methods.Two-Way ANOVA:Used when comparing the means based on two factors, and it can assess the interaction between these factors.Situation: Comparing the productivity of employees based on different software programs and different experience levels.Repeated Measures ANOVA:Used when the same subjects are measured multiple times under different conditions.Situation: Measuring the effect of different diets on the same group of participants over time.Q3: Partitioning of Variance in ANOVAIn ANOVA, the total variance is partitioned into components:Total Sum of Squares (SST): Measures the total variation in the data.Explained Sum of Squares (SSE): Measures the variation explained by the group differences.Residual Sum of Squares (SSR): Measures the variation within the groups.Understanding these components is crucial as it allows us to determine how much of the total variation is explained by the factors being studied.Q4: Calculating SST, SSE, and SSR in One-Way ANOVA Using PythonpythonCopy codeimport numpy as np\n",

    "Imputation: Replace missing values with estimated ones (mean, median, etc.).\n",

    "Consequences:Listwise Deletion: Loss of data can reduce the power and generalizability of the results.\n",
